# NeuroGenesis Project

The NeuroGenesis Project is a framework designed for dynamic control and optimization of neural networks with the ability to consult with GPT. The goal of the project is to create an intelligent system that can adapt to different training data and optimize its architecture and performance based on the metrics and characteristics of the data.

## Functions

- **MiniNet**: A small version of a neural network designed for data analysis and experimentation before deployment on the main network.
- **Communication with GPT**: NeuroGenesis can optionally consult GPT for recommendations on data processing, architecture changes, or performance optimization.
- **Dynamic Optimization**: Based on dataset characteristics and SagNeuroGenesis metrics, it adapts its structure and learning process.
